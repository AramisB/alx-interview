Project Overview
The "0. Island Perimeter" project aims to enhance your understanding of algorithms and data structures, specifically through the application of matrices (2D lists) and logical reasoning. The main objective is to calculate the perimeter of a single island represented in a grid, where the grid is defined by a 2D array of integers.

Problem Description
You will be given a grid of 0s and 1s, where:
1 represents land (part of the island)
0 represents water

The task is to compute the perimeter of the island formed by the 1s. The perimeter can be defined as the total length of the edges of the island cells that are not adjacent to other land cells.

Concepts Needed
2D Arrays (Matrices):
Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
Navigating through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

Conditional Logic:
Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

Counting Techniques:
Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

Problem-Solving Strategies:
Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

Python Programming:
Utilizing nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
Implementing conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.

Project Structure
Getting Started
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed. You can use any Python IDE or a simple text editor along with a command line interface.

Example
Given the following grid:

[[0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
The expected output for the perimeter calculation is 8.
Conclusion
By engaging with this project, you will reinforce your algorithmic thinking and improve your ability to manipulate data structures effectively. The "0. Island Perimeter" task provides a meaningful challenge that incorporates logical reasoning, conditional logic, and programming skills
