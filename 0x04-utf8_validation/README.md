Bitwise Operations in Python
Allow you to manipulate individual bits of data. Python supports several bitwise operators:

- AND (&): This operator performs a binary AND operation between two bits. The result is `1` if both corresponding bits are `1`; otherwise, it's 0.
  a = 0b1100  # 12 in binary
  b = 0b1010  # 10 in binary
  result = a & b  # result = 0b1000 (8 in decimal)
- OR (|): This operator performs a binary OR operation. The result is 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1; otherwise, it's 0.

 result = a | b  # result = 0b1110 (14 in decimal)
 
 - XOR (^): The XOR (exclusive OR) operation results in 1 if the corresponding bits are different; otherwise, it's 0.

result = a ^ b  # result = 0b0110 (6 in decimal)

- NOT (~): The NOT operation inverts all the bits in the operand, flipping 1 to 0 and vice versa. In Python, this also includes a sign bit, so it returns the negative of the value plus one.
result = ~a  # result = -0b1101 (-13 in decimal)

- Left Shift (<<): This operator shifts the bits to the left by a specified number of positions, filling the rightmost bits with zeros. Effectively, it multiplies the number by 2 for each shift.
result = a << 2  # result = 0b110000 (48 in decimal)

- Right Shift (>>): This operator shifts the bits to the right by a specified number of positions, discarding the rightmost bits. It effectively divides the number by 2 for each shift.

result = a >> 2  # result = 0b11 (3 in decimal)

 UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
Is a variable-length character encoding scheme that can represent every character in the Unicode character set. It uses one to four bytes to encode characters.

- Encoding Rules:
  - **1-byte characters**: For ASCII characters (U+0000 to U+007F), UTF-8 uses one byte, identical to the ASCII representation.
    - Example: `0xxxxxxx` where `x` is the data bit.
  - **2-byte characters**: Characters from U+0080 to U+07FF are encoded with two bytes.
    - Example: `110xxxxx 10xxxxxx`
  - **3-byte characters**: Characters from U+0800 to U+FFFF are encoded with three bytes.
    - Example: `1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`
  - **4-byte characters**: Characters from U+10000 to U+10FFFF are encoded with four bytes.
    - Example: `11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`

**Valid UTF-8 patterns**:
- A valid UTF-8 byte sequence should follow the above patterns, ensuring the correct number of continuation bytes (`10xxxxxx`) follow the leading byte.

Data Representation

At the byte level, data is represented as sequences of bits, typically grouped into bytes (8 bits). To work with data at this level in Python, you often manipulate the **least significant bits (LSB)**.

- **Simulating Byte Data**:
  - You can use bitwise operations to access or modify specific bits within an integer. For example, to set or clear a specific bit:
    number = 0b10101010  # example byte
    lsb = number & 0b00000001  # extract LSB
    - To represent data:
    byte_data = [0b11001100, 0b10101010]  # list of bytes
    
List Manipulation in Python

Python lists are versatile data structures that allow you to store collections of items. Hereâ€™s how you can manipulate them:

- **Iterating through lists**:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  for number in numbers:
      print(number)

- **Accessing list elements**:
 first_element = numbers[0]  # Accessing the first element
 
- **List comprehensions**:
 squares = [x**2 for x in numbers]  # Creates a new list with squares of the numbers
 
Boolean Logic

Boolean logic is used to make decisions in programming by evaluating expressions that return either `True` or `False`.

- **Logical operations**:
  - **AND (`and`)**: Returns `True` if both operands are true.
    result = True and False  # result = False
    
  - **OR (`or`)**: Returns `True` if at least one operand is true.
    result = True or False  # result = True
    
- **NOT (`not`)**: Inverts the truth value.
    
Boolean logic is fundamental in conditions, loops, and control flow in programming.

These concepts form a crucial foundation in understanding data manipulation, encoding, and logic in Python and software development in general.
