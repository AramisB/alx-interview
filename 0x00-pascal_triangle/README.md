Pascal's Triangle
Introduction
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two directly above it. Named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, it has been studied for centuries and appears in various branches of mathematics, including algebra, probability, and number theory.

Properties of Pascal's Triangle
Symmetry: Each row of Pascal's Triangle is symmetric.
Edges: The leftmost and rightmost elements of each row are always 1.
Summation: Each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
Binomial Expansion: The 
𝑛
n-th row represents the coefficients in the expansion of 
(𝑎+𝑏)^𝑛
 .
Binomial Coefficients
Each element in Pascal's Triangle corresponds to a binomial coefficient, denoted coefficient = factorial(i) // (factorial(j) * factorial(i - j))
Applications
Algebra: Used in the binomial theorem to expand expressions of the form 
(𝑎+𝑏)^𝑛
Combinatorics: Counts combinations and permutations.
Probability: Appears in the calculations of probabilities in binomial distributions.
Number Theory: Connections with Fibonacci numbers, prime numbers, and Catalan numbers.

Generating Pascal's Triangle in Python
Below is a Python function to generate Pascal's Triangle using the binomial coefficient formula:

from math import factorial

def pascal_triangle_binomial(n):
    """
    Generates Pascal's Triangle using the binomial coefficient formula.
    """
    triangle = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(i + 1):
            # Calculate binomial coefficient using factorial
            coefficient = factorial(i) // (factorial(j) * factorial(i - j))
            row.append(coefficient)
        triangle.append(row)
    return triangle

Code Explanation
Importing Factorial Function: The factorial function from the math module is imported to calculate the factorial of a number.

Function Definition: The function pascal_triangle_binomial(n) generates Pascal's Triangle up to the n-th row.

Outer Loop: The outer loop iterates over each row 
𝑖
i from 0 to 
𝑛
−
1
n−1.

Inner Loop: The inner loop iterates over each element 
𝑗
j in the 
𝑖
i-th row. It calculates the binomial coefficient using the formula:

coefficient
=
𝑖
!
𝑗
!
(
𝑖
−
𝑗
)
!
coefficient= 
j!(i−j)!
i!
​
 
Appending Rows: Each calculated coefficient is appended to the current row, and each row is appended to the triangle.

Returning the Triangle: The function returns the generated triangle as a list of lists.
