To solve the problem of determining the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in a file, using only the operations "Copy All" and "Paste", we need to take advantage of the mathematical properties of factors and prime numbers. Here's the reasoning behind the solution:

Explanation
Understanding Operations:

Copy All: Copies the entire content of the file.
Paste: Pastes the copied content.

Basic Concept:
Each operation sequence involves copying all and then pasting multiple times.
To get to n H's efficiently, you should repeatedly multiply the current number of H's by copying all and pasting.

Prime Factorization:
The optimal way to reach n H's is by breaking down n into its prime factors.
Each prime factor corresponds to a "Copy All" followed by several "Pastes".

Steps to Solution
Prime Factor Decomposition:

Break down n into its prime factors.
For each prime factor, you need one "Copy All" and then (prime factor - 1) "Pastes".
Summing Operations:

Total operations = sum of each prime factor (including both "Copy All" and subsequent "Pastes").

Implementation
Here's the Python code to calculate the minimum operations:

python
def minOperations(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    
    operations = 0
    factor = 2
    
    while n > 1:
        while n % factor == 0:
            operations += factor
            n //= factor
        factor += 1
    
    return operations
How the Code Works
Initial Checks:

If n is 1 or less, it's impossible to achieve more than one H with any number of operations. Hence, return 0.
Prime Factor Decomposition:

Start with the smallest prime factor (2).
While n is divisible by the current factor, divide n by the factor and add the factor to the operation count.
Increment the factor to check the next potential factor.
Summing Factors:

Each factor decomposition step (division) corresponds to the minimal number of operations needed to achieve that factor.
Example Walkthrough
For n = 9:

Prime factor decomposition of 9: 
9=3Ã—3
Operations:
First 3: Copy All + Paste + Paste = 3 operations.
Second 3: Copy All + Paste + Paste = 3 operations.
Total = 3 + 3 = 6 operations.
Thus, the method returns 6 for n = 9.

This approach ensures we use the fewest operations by leveraging the prime factor decomposition of n.
