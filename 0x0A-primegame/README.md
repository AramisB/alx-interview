Prime Numbers and Game Theory Competitive Game
This project challenges you to combine concepts of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The goal is to determine the winner of the game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

Concepts Required
1. Prime Numbers
Understanding prime numbers is crucial for solving the problem. You will need to:
Know what a prime number is: a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
Implement efficient algorithms to identify prime numbers within a range of numbers.

Khan Academy - Prime Numbers

2. Sieve of Eratosthenes
To efficiently find all prime numbers up to a given limit, the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm can be used. It is particularly helpful for large sets of numbers where prime identification needs to be done quickly.

Steps:
Initialize a boolean array representing the numbers.
Start with the smallest prime (2) and eliminate all its multiples.
Continue the process for the next unmarked number.

3. Game Theory
The game involves two players who take turns removing numbers from a set. The removal of prime numbers and their multiples follows specific rules that require strategic planning to win.

Key Concepts:
Turns: Players take turns in removing numbers.
Optimal Play: Players need to use strategies that lead to an eventual win or force the opponent into a losing position.
Win Conditions: A player wins by being able to make the last legal move.

4. Dynamic Programming/Memoization
To optimize the game solution, you will use dynamic programming techniques. By caching previous results (memoization), you can speed up future calculations, especially for solving multiple rounds of the game with varying inputs.

5. Python Programming
The solution will be implemented in Python, utilizing loops, conditional logic, and data structures such as arrays/lists. You will need a good understanding of:

Loops and Conditionals: To handle game logic and decision-making.
Lists: To store the consecutive integers and track which numbers have been removed.

Python Official Documentation - Lists

Implementation Approach
Input the Range: Start with a consecutive set of integers.
Prime Identification: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to identify prime numbers within the set.
Game Logic: Players take turns to remove primes and their multiples, and the game continues until no valid moves remain.
Dynamic Programming: Implement memoization to store results of previously solved subproblems.
Determine the Winner: Using game theory, simulate both players making optimal moves and calculate who will win.
